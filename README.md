# Task : Customer-Segmentation
Data Storm 5.0 - Storming Round Task : Approach: TensorFlow Decision Forests 

The task involves predicting customer segments based on demographic and behavioral data. This repository contains code for a customer segmentation task using TensorFlow Decision Forests (tfdf).  The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations to understand spending patterns, and feature engineering to enhance model performance. The model, a Random Forest classifier, is trained on labeled data to classify customers into predefined segments based on spending patterns. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and additional regression metrics are used to assess model performance. Visualizations of decision trees provide insights into feature importance and segmentation criteria, making it suitable for data-driven marketing strategies.
